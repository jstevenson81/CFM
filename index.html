                        CrossFit is the principal strength and conditioning program for many police academies, tactical operations teams, military
                        operations units, and other elite professional athletes worldwide. CrossFit delivers a fitness regime
                        that is broad, general, and inclusive.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                        Our speciality in CrossFit is not specializing in any one area. Combat, survival, many sports and life, in general, reward
                        this kind of fitness and, on average, punish the specialist. CrossFit is designed to be universally
                        scalable, meaning it’s the perfect application for any individual regardless of fitness experience.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                        We don’t change our programming for each individual, but we do scale the load and intensity. We use the same routine for
                        elderly individuals as we do professional athletes.

                            A native of Texas, Ginger comes to us with a background in running and cycling and was a D1 collegiate athlete. Her son,
                            Cam, also plays D1 soccer in South Carolina. Although her career is in the corporate world, she
                            is an artist/metalsmith with a concentration in jewelry design. She has varied interests outside
                            of the box including frequent travel and her dogs Mav and Hoss.

                            As a Managing Partner of CFM, athlete, and overall curious human she works diligently to continue expanding her knowledge
                            of CrossFit and functional movement through additional certifications, research, and her own
                            training. One of her favorite aspects to CrossFit is its scalability and progressive nature.
                            "When you can scale workouts but still derive an intensity that makes the workout relative to
                            all levels of athletes, that's so much more appealing and successful. On the other side of that,
                            I respect how well versed you must be in all of the movements in order to achieve well rounded
                            athleticism. You can lift heavy all day long but if you can't run an 800 or do a virtuous hollow
                            rock, you're impeding your own progress(and vice versa)."

                            Her advice for anyone would be never sacrifice form and technique for a PR or a "good" score. Listen to your body. Mobilize.
                            Listen to your coach. Be patient and don't hesitate to use scales and progressions while you
                            are learning to become proficient. Great movement takes time.

                            A native of Slidell, Louisiana, Dustin grew up participating in sports from a young age. He played football and ran track
                            at Slidell High School. He attended Southeastern Louisiana University for 2 years and while there
                            walked on the football team.

                            True to his passion for helping people and his community, Dustin has been a firefighter in Slidell for 8 years. He is certified
                            as an EMT, with goals of furthering his career as a paramedic in the next couple of years. Dustin
                            began doing CrossFit in2010 because he was looking for a workout that would “challenge” him.
                            CrossFit lived up to its claims and shortly after, he obtained his Level 1 certification and
                            began coaching CrossFit. Dustin’s favorite thing about coaching CrossFit is the opportunity to
                            teach people new skills they never imagined they could do, and helping them have fun along the
                            way!
