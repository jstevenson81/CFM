                        <strong>What made you start doing SkinnyFit?</strong>
                        <br />I needed a change in my life. I was going to the gym, doing cardio but I got bored.  I was so nervous at first because I didn’t know anyone but I am so happy that I made the change and joined CF Mandeville.

                        <br />I like that we can work at our own pace. Also, I love Coach Lisa! She pushes me and encourages me to do better. She is the best! Love her!!

                        <strong>Tell us a fun fact about yourself?</strong>
                        <br />I raised 2 beautiful children as a single Mom, while I worked a fulltime job and put myself through college. It wasn’t easy, but it was definitely worth it!

                        <strong>What is your athletic background?</strong>
                        <br />Zero! Never was an athlete…I went to dancing school for many years…don’t think that counts as being an athlete LOL

                        <strong>How has SkinnyFit changed your life/lifestyle/level of fitness?</strong>
                        <br />It has definitely made me stronger and I feel more confident about myself.

                        <strong>What is your proudest SkinnyFit achievement?</strong>
                        <br />I think my proudest moment was when I could do abmat situps without stopping. When I first started SkinnyFit, I couldn’t even do 10. During one class recently, we did 200 situps and I felt great that I was able to finish that workout!

                        <strong>Name one goal/personal achievement that you would like to accomplish through crossfit?</strong>
                        <br />I would like to finally reach my goal weight that I have been struggling with for a long time.

                        <strong>What are your hobbies/interests outside of CF?</strong>
                        <br />Reading is my favorite hobby. I also enjoy going to local festivals and concerts with my friends and family.

                        <strong>What advice would you give to new members?</strong>
                        <br />Don’t be a hero, SkinnyFit is humbling. Come to class to enhance your personal fitness, challenge yourself, but do not base your performance on others. Celebrate the accomplishments, rather it be a 2.5lb increase in weight or RXing your first workout. It’s exciting. You will see all levels of fitness in this gym, some should have theme music play as they do pullups, others, like myself, march to the beat of a different drum killin’ the ring rows! Intimidating? Perhaps. Motivating? Definitely.
