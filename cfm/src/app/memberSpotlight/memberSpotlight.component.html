                    <strong>How long have you been CrossFitting?</strong><br /> About 5 years on and off for both of us.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What's your favorite lift/movement</strong><br />
                    Jenny - I'd have to say candlesticks because you really have to focus on your core to do them right. 
                    Burpees because it's a total body workout. And box step-ups because I feel itâ€™s the one move that really 
                    forced me to strengthen my weaker leg. <br />
                    Stew - WallBalls and rowing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What is your favorite CrossFit memory? (specifically, with your spouse)</strong><br />
                    Jenny - Favorite CrossFit memory would have to be the first team WOD Stu and I did together. 
                    We argued the whole time but I feel it pushed us both to work a little harder during the WOD.<br />
                    Stew - I feel the same as Jenny team WOD or as Jenny and I like to call it, The Fight WOD has to be my favorite CrossFit memories.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What advice would you give to other CrossFit couples/families?</strong><br />
                    Jenny - Keep working out together. Motivate and push each other to become stronger and better athletes together.<br />
                    Stew - Make time to get in the Gym no matter what.
