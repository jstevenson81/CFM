                    <strong>How long have you been CrossFitting?</strong><br />
                    My wife and I answered an ad in the Pelican Park newsletter for intro classes with Lakeshore CrossFit.  
                    We went with another couple.  They didn’t come back; we did.

                    <strong>What is your athletic background?</strong><br />
                    Played high school sports, then military, after that only outdoor activities until discovering CrossFit.

                    <strong>How has CrossFit change your life, lifestyle, level of fitness?</strong><br />
                    I have been able to increase my metabolism, sleep better, and my endurance level is on par with what it was 
                    when I was 30 years younger.  I have largely ditched bad dietary habits and am strong that I have been 
                    probably since my teens.

                <li>
                    <strong>What is your proudest CrossFit achievement?</strong><br />
                    I am most pleased with being able to hold my own with some folks many years my junior.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Name one goal/personal achievement that you would like to accomplish through CrossFit?</strong><br />
                    I would like to be able to string together RX muscle-ups.

                <li>
                    <strong>What are your hobbies/interests outside of CrossFit?</strong><br />
                    I enjoy outdoor activities, camping, anything at the beach, travel and shooting.

                <li>
                    <strong>What is your favorite cheat meal?</strong><br />
                    Ribs with German potato salad, greens and beer.

                    <strong>Any advice for new members?</strong><br />
                    Don’t sell yourself short; I never saw myself being able to do strict HSPUs but had them 
                    nailed within a year of starting CrossFit.
