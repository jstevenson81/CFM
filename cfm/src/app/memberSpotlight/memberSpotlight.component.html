                    <br /> Amanda Marcus, 37, Health Insurance

                        <strong>How long have you been doing CF and what class do you normally attend?</strong>
                        <br />4 months (give or take a holiday month…those shouldn’t count); I attend the noon class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What made you start doing Crossfit?</strong>
                        <br />My cousin and her husband are both avid CrossFit enthusiasts. He a coach and she a much later convert. 
                        However, both quite convincing, so I joined to either debunk this “CrossFit is life” theme or to drink the Kool-Aid. 
                        Most days I leave the gym feeling like dunking my head in said Kool-Aid.

                        <strong>What is your favorite lift or movement?</strong>
                        <br />Thrusters, they require much less thought and coordination.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What do you enjoy most about CF?</strong>
                        <br />CrossFit is the most intense, yet rewarding experience. You are motivated to push yourself in ways you never imagined wanting to or being able to. 
                        No two classes are the same and you will never get bored or leave a class thinking… I can’t even tell I worked out. The coaches are so patient and will modify ANYTHING to fit your skill level.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Tell us a fun fact about yourself?</strong>
                        <br />Too much pressure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What is your athletic background?</strong>
                        <br />No serious athletic background to speak of. I was a swimmer and had quite the character building 2 months of soccer, if that counts. I am not a traditional gym fan, I gravitate toward classes so that is another reason I am really enjoying CrossFit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How has Crossfit changed your life/lifestyle/level of fitness?</strong>
                        <br />How CF has changed my life in two words…. NOON. CLASS. Level of fitness: I feel stronger and look forward to setting and achieving new fitness goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What is your proudest CF achievement?</strong>
                        <br />Getting that jump rope around twice without lashing myself! I was so shocked when it happened I had to announce it to the class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Name one goal/personal achievement that you would like to accomplish through crossfit?</strong>
                        <br />One way or another I am getting my chin above that bar for a pull-up.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>What are your hobbies/interests outside of CF?</strong>
                        <br />I like seeing new places and spending time with family.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What advice would you give to new members?</strong>
                        <br />Don’t be a hero, CrossFit is humbling. Come to class to enhance your personal fitness, challenge yourself, but do not base your performance on others. Celebrate the accomplishments, rather it be a 2.5lb increase in weight or RXing your first workout. It’s exciting. You will see all levels of fitness in this gym, some should have theme music play as they do pullups, others, like myself, march to the beat of a different drum killin’ the ring rows! Intimidating? Perhaps. Motivating? Definitely.

                        <strong>What is your favorite cheat meal?</strong>
                        <br />Cheat Meal? Was I supposed to be dieting?
