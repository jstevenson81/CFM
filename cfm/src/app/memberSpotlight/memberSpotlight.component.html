                        <strong>What made you start doing Crossfit?</strong>
                        <br />My buddy kept pestering me to improve my lifestyle and he believed that CrossFit was the perfect way to do that. Eventually I ran out of excuses to not try it.

                        <strong>Tell us a fun fact about yourself?</strong>
                        <br />The muscles in my eyes are different than normal so I can somewhat individually control where each eye is looking.

                    <li>
                        <strong>What is your athletic background?</strong>
                        <br />Some martial arts when I was younger, and a very limited experience with weight lifting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How has Crossfit changed your life/lifestyle/level of fitness?</strong>
                        <br />Physically I have lost weight and generally feel healthier, but mentally CrossFit has helped with my happiness, confidence, and self-esteem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What is your proudest Crossfit achievement?</strong>
                        <br />So far that would be being able to deadlift my body weight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Name one goal/personal achievement that you would like to accomplish through crossfit?</strong>
                        <br />Being able to do ring muscle ups one day would be pretty cool.

                    <li>
                        <strong>What are your hobbies/interests outside of CF?</strong>
                        <br />Video games and occasionally shooting my bow.

                    <li>
                        <strong>What advice would you give to new members?</strong>
                        <br />Personally, I had a bad habit of making up excuses to not go when I first started. So the biggest tip that I can think of is to not get into the habit of talking yourself out of going. Making CrossFit a normal part of my daily routine was what helped me the most with that.
