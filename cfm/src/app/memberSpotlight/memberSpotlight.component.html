                    <strong>How long have you been doing CF and what class do you normally attend?</strong><br />
                    I’ve been doing CF for 3 ½ years but consistently for a year and a half. I attend 6:00 am and Skinny Fit. I also enjoy Saturday am Team WOD. 
                    It’s fun to catch up with friends that work out at different times.

                    <strong>What made you start doing CF?</strong><br />
                    I have always worked out and ran but was very bored with the same routine and wanted to try something new and challenging. I convinced my husband Paul to join with me since it was
                    something we could do together. That is one of the greatest things about CF. It is like a mini date every morning. Haha

                    <strong>What is your athletic background?</strong><br />
                    I have always enjoyed working out and been a gym member since high school. I did group cardio classes, spin, and played tennis for several years.

                    <strong>What's your favorite lift/movement</strong><br />
                    My favorite movement is power cleans.

                    <strong>How has CF changed your life/lifestyle/level of fitness?</strong><br />
                   I am in the best shape of my life. I am able to carry all of my groceries in one trip!

                    <strong>What do you enjoy most about CF?</strong><br />
                    What I enjoy most about CF is the variety of movements and endless combinations of workout. I have yet to get bored! I added Skinny Fit to my program and it
                    has really helped my endurance. I would recommend everyone give it a try.

                    <strong>What is your proudest CF achievement?</strong><br />
                    My proudest achievements are pullups and double unders. It took a long time to get them but once it clicked it was “easy”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Name one goal/personal achievement that you would like to accomplish through CF.</strong><br />
                    I would love to be able to string together toes to bar!

                <li>
                    <strong>What are your hobbies/interests outside of CF?</strong><br />
                    Outside of CF, I like to travel, read, hang out with my teenagers and play with my 3 dogs.

                    <strong>What advice would you give to new members?</strong><br />
                    Consistency! Show up every day even if there are movements that you haven’t mastered. You can scale them. Listen to the coaches!

                    <strong>What is your favorite cheat meal?</strong><br />
                    PIZZA! And not the kind that is delivered to your house.
